        <h1 class="supply">SUPPLY
            <p class="supply-description">Supply, when used in a candlestick chart context, is the maximum a price will likely move up to because of the RESISTANCE LEVEL. This is helpful to traders because it provides an insight for when to exit a trade. Once stocks reach a supply level, they most commonly fall back down and repeat the process until demand becomes strong enough to break the level. If you are having trouble remembering what supply means, think of this: The company is limiting the amount of money (SUPPLY) for investors to make, and therefore the price can't move higher than the resistance line because the company is RESISTING to let the price go higher.</p>

        <h1 class="demand">DEMAND
            <p class="supply-description">Demand, when used in a candlestick chart context, is the minimum a price will likely move below because of the SUPPORT LEVEL. This is helpful to traders because it provides an insight for when to enter a trade. Once stocks fall to a demand level, they most commonly bounce up and may break the supply level if there is enough pressure from demand. If you are having trouble remembering what demand means, think of this: The investors of the company are furious that they are being limited to the amount of money they can make, and DEMAND the price goes higher. Once enough SUPPORT for this movement builds up, they break the companies resistance level, and are able to make more money than what they were previously capped to.</p>
