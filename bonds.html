        <footer class="bonds-intro-sentences">Bonds represent a loan make by an investor to a borrower. In simple terms, it is an IOU between 2 parties. Bonds are used by companies, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects. Bonds are also referred to as FIXED INCOME SECURITIES because they require payments in the form of interest payments; if interest rates on new bonds go up, the value of old bonds go down because they aren't wanted as much since with a higher interest rate, the creditors make more money. The opposite is also true: If new bonds have lower interest rates than old ones, prices of old bonds increases and new bond prices lower because the creditor can't make as much off the interest payments.</footer>
