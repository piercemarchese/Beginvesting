Everything on here is extracted from my own hand written notes which I have been making for about 2 years. I am excited to share this knowledge with you as a user of this website because everyone needs a starting point, and I would love to be that beginning of your journey.</footer>

            How's the market this week?
            <p>Stocks had an extremely strong week, especially at the end. Oscillators and MA's signal the market should have another great week coming up. Investors are finally calming down after the collapse of several small banks, leading to a more bullish outlook on the future.</p>
