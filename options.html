            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>&bull; AT-THE-MONEY OPTIONS - Any option with a strike price close to the stock price</li>
                <li>&bull; EXPIRATION DATE - The time in which all option contracts expire and become worthless. </li>
                <li>&bull; EXTRINSIC VALUE - The portion of the option that exceeds its intrinsic value; EV is sometimes called "time value"</li>
                <li>&bull; IMPLIED VOLATILITY - The expected magnitude of a stocks price change</li>
                <li>&bull; IN-THE-MONEY OPTIONS - Any option with intrinsic value</li>
                <li>&bull; INTRINSIC VALUE - How much the option contract is worth</li>
                <li>&bull; OPEN INTEREST - The total number of contracts that are "open" between buyers and sellers</li>
                <li>&bull; OPTION CONTRACT MULTIPLIER - If an option contract costs $5, you need $500 because options are used to trade 100 shares of stock</li>
                <li>&bull; OPTION PREMIUM - The price for having the ability to exercise an option</li>
                <li>&bull; OUT-OF-THE-MONEY OPTIONS - Any option with only extrinsic value</li>
                <li>&bull; POTENTIAL PAYOFF - The minimum price a stock needs to rise above in order for an option contract owner to make money</li>
                <li>&bull; STRIKE PRICE - The price an option can be converted into shares of stock</li>   
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader"> CALLS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>&bull; When a buyer purchases a call contract, they are betting that the price of the stock will increase</li>
                <li>&bull; The value of the contract incerases when the stock price goes up and decreases when the stock price goes down (direct relationship)</li>
                <li>&bull; When trading options, you should almost NEVER exercise the contract; in many cases, it will be more profitable to jsut sell the contract to someone else</li>
                <li>&bull; If the stock price doesn't go up, you will lose money on the trade (whatever the option premium is)</li>
                <li>&bull; To calculate the potential payoff for a call, you add the strike price and the option premium together</li>
                <li>&ndash; EXAMPLE: $50 strike call + $5 premium means that the stock price needs to rise above $55 in order for the contract owner to start making money</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader"> PUTS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>&bull; When a buyer purchases a put contract, they are betting that the price of the stock will decrease</li>
                <li>&bull; The value of the contract incerases when the stock price goes down and decreases when the stock price goes up (inverse relationship)</li>
                <li>&bull; A put option can be used to sell 100 shares of a stock at its strike price</li>
                <li>&bull; Buying puts are far safer than shorting a call option because there is a theoretical infinite risk with shorting while with puts the risk is the premium</li>
                <li>&bull; To calculate the potential payoff for a call, you subtract the strike price and the option premium together</li>
                <li>&ndash; EXAMPLE: $50 strike put - $5 premium means that the stock needs to drop below $45 in order for the contract owner to start making money</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 class="bondstextheader">OPTIONS PRICE COMPONENTS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>&bull; INTRINSIC VALUE - How much the option contract is worth</li>
                <li>&bull; Call: Stock price - Strike price</li>
                <li>&bull; Put: Strike Price - Stock Price</li>
                <li>&bull; EXTRINSIC VALUE - The portion of the option that exceeds its intrinsic value; options with longer expiration dates have more extrinsic value</li>
                <li>&bull; ITM Calls - The strike price is below the stock price and has intrinsic value</li>
                <li>&bull; ITM Puts - The strike price is above the stock price and has intrinsic value</li>
                <li>&bull; OTM Calls - The strike price is above the stock price and has extrinsic value</li>
                <li>&bull; OTM Puts - The strike price is above the stock price and has extrinsic value</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 class="bondstextheader">IMPLIED VOLATILITY
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>&bull; The expected magnitude of a stock price change</li>
                <li>&bull; The higher the implied volatility a stock has, the more large price movements traders expect</li>
                <li>&bull; Higher volatility = Higher premium</li>
                <li>&bull; Higher volatility indicated large movements up or down</li>
                <li>&bull; When buying options you can make money off of an increase in implied volatility</li>
                <li>&bull; Changes in option prices drive changes in implied volatility</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader">THE OPTION GREEKS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
               <li>&bull; DELTA (Δ) - The amount of money you make for every dollar the stock goes up
                <ol>
                    <li>&ndash; A $1 change in Δ means a $100 increase in profit</li>
                    <li>&ndash; Calls have positive delta and puts have negative delta</li>
                </ol>
               </li>
               <li>&bull; GAMMA (Γ) - The rate of change between Δ and the assets price
                <ol>
                    <li>&ndash; ATM options have the highest gamma becaise they are the most sensitive to price changes</li>
                    <li>&ndash; Higher gamma values indicated Δ could change dramatically with even with small price changes</li>
                    <li>&ndash; The greater Γ, the more volatile the option is</li>
                </ol>
               </li>
               <li>&bull; THETA (Θ) - How much the price of an option shold decreasee every day as the option nears expiration (also called time decay)
                 <ol>
                    <li>&ndash; If you want to own an option, you should buy longer-term contracts</li>
                    <li>&ndash; If you want to make money off of time decay, purchase shorter term contracts</li>
                    <li>&ndash; Time decay is NOT linear</li>
                 </ol>
                </li>
               <li>&bull; VEGA (ν) - How much an option's price should move when there is a change in VOLATILITY
                <ol>
                    <li>&ndash; A drop in ν causes calls and puts to drop in value</li>
                </ol>
               </li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader">HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT STRIKE PRICE AND OPTION?
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>&bull; As previously stated, the strike price is the price a call/put can be exercised</li>
                <li>&bull; The more out of the money the strike price is, the more risky</li>
                <li>&bull; In other words, if a strike price is above the stock price, it is more risky; if the strike price is below the stock price, it is less risky</li>
                <li>&bull; This means that although an OTM strike price is more risky, there is the potential to make more money than a more conservative ITM option </li>
                <li>&bull; Consider the following before picking a strike price: Risk tolerance & reward payoff</li>
                <li>&bull; OTM Calls/Puts: Higher risk, cheaper premium cost, smaller chance of success</li>
                <li>&bull; ITM Calls/Puts: Less risk, premiums are higher</li>
                <li>&bull; ATM Calls/Puts: Less risk, no intrinsic value, but have time value</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
