        <h1 class="bondstextheader"> OPTIONS BASICS AND TERMS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>AT-THE-MONEY OPTIONS - Any option with a strike price close to the stock price</li>
                <li>EXPIRATION DATE - The time in which all option contracts expire and become worthless. </li>
                <li>EXTRINSIC VALUE - The portion of the option that exceeds its intrinsic value; EV is sometimes called "time value"</li>
                <li>IMPLIED VOLATILITY - The expected magnitude of a stocks price change</li>
                <li>IN-THE-MONEY OPTIONS - Any option with intrinsic value</li>
                <li>INTRINSIC VALUE - How much the option contract is worth</li>
                <li>OPEN INTEREST - The total number of contracts that are "open" between buyers and sellers</li>
                <li>OPTION CONTRACT MULTIPLIER - If an option contract costs $5, you need $500 because options are used to trade 100 shares of stock</li>
                <li>OPTION PREMIUM - The price for having the ability to exercise an option</li>
                <li>OUT-OF-THE-MONEY OPTIONS - Any option with only extrinsic value</li>
                <li>POTENTIAL PAYOFF - The minimum price a stock needs to rise above in order for an option contract owner to make money</li>
                <li>STRIKE PRICE - The price an option can be converted into shares of stock</li>   
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader"> CALLS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>When a buyer purchases a call contract, they are betting that the price of the stock will increase</li>
                <li>The value of the contract incerases when the stock price goes up and decreases when the stock price goes down (direct relationship)</li>
                <li>When trading options, you should almost NEVER exercise the contract; in many cases, it will be more profitable to jsut sell the contract to someone else</li>
                <li>If the stock price doesn't go up, you will lose money on the trade (whatever the option premium is)</li>
                <li>To calculate the potential payoff for a call, you add the strike price and the option premium together</li>
                <li>EXAMPLE: $50 strike call + $5 premium means that the stock price needs to rise above $55 in order for the contract owner to start making money</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader"> PUTS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>When a buyer purchases a put contract, they are betting that the price of the stock will decrease</li>
                <li>The value of the contract incerases when the stock price goes down and decreases when the stock price goes up (inverse relationship)</li>
                <li>A put option can be used to sell 100 shares of a stock at its strike price</li>
                <li>Buying puts are far safer than shorting a call option because there is a theoretical infinite risk with shorting while with puts the risk is the premium</li>
                <li>To calculate the potential payoff for a call, you subtract the strike price and the option premium together</li>
                <li>EXAMPLE: $50 strike put - $5 premium means that the stock needs to drop below $45 in order for the contract owner to start making money</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader">OPTIONS PRICE COMPONENTS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>INTRINSIC VALUE - How much the option contract is worth</li>
                <li>Call: Stock price - Strike price</li>
                <li>Put: Strike Price - Stock Price</li>
                <li>EXTRINSIC VALUE - The portion of the option that exceeds its intrinsic value; options with longer expiration dates have more extrinsic value</li>
                <li>ITM Calls - The strike price is below the stock price and has intrinsic value</li>
                <li>ITM Puts - The strike price is above the stock price and has intrinsic value</li>
                <li>OTM Calls - The strike price is above the stock price and has extrinsic value</li>
                <li>OTM Puts - The strike price is above the stock price and has extrinsic value</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader">IMPLIED VOLATILITY
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>The expected magnitude of a stock price change</li>
                <li>The higher the implied volatility a stock has, the more large price movements traders expect</li>
                <li>Higher volatility = Higher premium</li>
                <li>Higher volatility indicated large movements up or down</li>
                <li>When buying options you can make money off of an increase in implied volatility</li>
                <li>Changes in option prices drive changes in implied volatility</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader">THE OPTION GREEKS
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
               <li>DELTA (Δ) - The amount of money you make for every dollar the stock goes up. A $1 change in Δ means $100. Calls have positive delta and puts have negative delta</li>
               <li>GAMMA (Γ) - The rate of change between Δ and the assets price. ATM options have the highest gamma becaise they are the most sensitive to price changes. Higher gamma values indicated Δ could change dramatically with even with small price changes. The greater Γ, the more volatile the option is</li>
               <li>THETA (Θ) - How much the price of an option shold decreasee every day as the option nears expiration (also called time decay). If you want to own an option, you should buy longer-term contracts. If you want to make money off of time decay, purchase shorter term contracts. Time decay is NOT linear</li>
               <li>VEGA (ν) - How much an option's price should move when there is a change in volatility. A drop in ν causes calls and puts to drop in value</li>
            </ul>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bondstextheader">HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT STRIKE PRICE AND OPTION?
            <ul class="bondsdescription">
                <li>As previously stated, the strike price is the price a call/put can be exercised</li>
                <li>The more out of the money the strike price is, the more risky</li>
                <li>In other words, if a strike price is above the stock price, it is more risky; if the strike price is below the stock price, it is less risky</li>
                <li>This means that although an OTM strike price is more risky, there is the potential to make more money than a more conservative ITM option </li>
                <li>Consider the following before picking a strike price: Risk tolerance & reward payoff</li>
                <li>OTM Calls/Puts: Higher risk, cheaper premium cost, smaller chance of success</li>
                <li>ITM Calls/Puts: Less risk, premiums are higher</li>
                <li>ATM Calls/Puts: Less risk, no intrinsic value, but have time value</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
