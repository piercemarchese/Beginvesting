                <li>Collateral - Something pledged to be a form or repayment in the event of a default; collected by the lender</li>
                <li>SECURED DEBT - Debt that is backed up by collateral</li>
                <li>UNSECURED DEBT - Debt that isn't backed by collateral</li>
                <li>Defaults occur on secured debt, such as mortgage loans or bonds</li>
                <li>Defaults can also occur on unsecured debt, such as credit cards or student loans</li>
                <li>EXAMPLE: "I couldn't pay my mortgage on my house, so the bank seized it"</li>

        <h1 class="supply"> HOW TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF OTHER PEOPLE DEFAULITING ON PAYMENTS
            <p class="supply-description">
                <li>As it turns out, banks and hedge funds make large amounts of money off of betting that people will default on their payments</li>
                <li>An example of their success was betting against the housing market in 2008</li>
                <li>Logically speaking, when spendings are hitting record highs, that is the best time to buy CDS's (Credit Default Swaps) because people are spending large amounts of money and are more likely to default on loans and purchases.</li>
